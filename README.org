* Semi secret filesystem
** About
This is a FUSE-based cryptographic filesystem, inpsired by [[https://github.com/vgough/encfs][EncFS]] and [[https://github.com/cryfs/cryfs][CryFS]]. This encrypts a directory
transparently such that it can be synced with a cloud storage provider without leaking the contents of the
files stored. However, some metadata will be leaked, for performance reasons, hence the name.
** Things to do
*** Short term
- [ ] Add appropriate cargo warnings
- [ ] Sketch out structure of filesystem in a document
** Feature wishlist
- [ ] One-to-one mapping between plaintext files and ciphertext files (except for some exceptions, like ~.git~
  directories)
- [ ] Encrypt eagerly only on write
- [ ] Notify sync daemon on write
- [ ] Decrypt eagerly on cloud update
- [ ] Cache (and not encrypt) ignored files, like build directories
- [ ] Checksums?
